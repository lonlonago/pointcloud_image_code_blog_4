 core point of view 

 The inflection point of the VR/AR industry has emerged: VR/AR experienced a capital boom in 2016, but due to the immature timing, it gradually cooled down. With the continuous investment of industrial capital, the continuous release of policy dividends, and the continuous efforts of industry giants in hardware, software, content, and applications, the VR/AR industry has been improved in all aspects, and the integration of application scenarios and VR/AR has been continuously improved. The industry has turned warm and ushered in an inflection point. Since March 2020, benefiting from the promotion of the popular VR game ALYX, the VR market has ushered in great attention, and VR/AR is expected to usher in an upward inflection point. 

 5G is expected to open the VR/AR ceiling: 5G has the characteristics of low latency and large bandwidth, which can realize cloud VR/AR solutions, use the powerful CPU and GPU in the cloud to complete calculation and rendering, and use 5G to complete transmission to VR/AR devices. It not only realizes better content while reducing the computing power requirements of the end point of the all-in-one machine, but also saves costs. At the same time, due to the reduction of computing power, it also reduces the demand for heat dissipation, which helps to save unnecessary heat dissipation modules and reduce the volume and weight of the end point of the all-in-one machine, making it more lightweight. The cloud VR/AR solution in the 5G era can significantly improve the user experience, which is expected to further open the C-end market and drive the development of the B-end market such as education, medical care, tourism, shopping, real estate, engineering and other scenarios, thus completely opening the industry ceiling.

 VR/AR development history 

 In 2019, industry giants released new products intensively, and product technology was significantly upgraded. VR/AR is becoming cheaper and easier to use. VR products: In 2019, Valve released its first VR product, Valve Index HMD, and Oculus (Facebook), HTC, Huawei, Xiaomi and other manufacturers have also launched new VR hardware products. The new generation of products is constantly improving and overcoming the painpoints of VR/AR devices in the past, and the price has become affordable. VR/AR is expected to usher in rapid development.

 VR/AR product launches by major manufacturers in 2019 

 The core pain points are gradually overcome, and VR/AR is expected to usher in high-speed growth. All-round hardware upgrades will greatly improve the immersive experience. Users have been looking forward to VR/AR for a long time. The core reason is that VR/AR can bring immersive experiences to users. Combined with many industries, especially in the gaming, travel, and film industries, through panoramic visual, touch, hear, and smell interactive experiences, people have an immersive feeling. The application of VR/AR technology can bring humans into the era of "time travel" and "virtual world".

 VR/AR technology development 

 AR optical waveguide technology is gradually maturing and is expected to lead AR glasses to the consumer market. There are four main AR optical display solutions, including prisms, curved reflectors, optical waveguide solutions and light field display solutions.

 Comparison of four main optical schemes of AR 

 Perceptual interaction: The depth camera is mature to help space positioning and 3D input, 6 + 6DoF is very large, and the inside-out space positioning method has become a development trend to improve the user interaction experience. There are currently two main types of VR/AR device space positioning: Outside-in and Inside-out. Outside-in is an outward-inward motion tracking device, using an external tracking device, such as a camera or Lighthouse, and tagging the headset to track the motion of the headset. Outside-in technology has obvious advantages, high accuracy, and because the amount of data transmitted is small, the delay of calculation is also low, which reduces the discomfort caused by some delays. And alternative solutions are more mature, reducing costs to a certain extent. However, this method also has significant shortcomings: 

 1) Occlusion: If you suddenly squat down and are blocked by an object, the sensor will not be able to track the user's location. 

 2) Space limitations: Outside-in will set the user in a range such as 3 × 3, and once out of range, the sensor cannot track it. 

 3) Setup is cumbersome: Before playing the game, you need to turn on the power supply of two sensors. In contrast to Outside-in, Inside-out is an inside-out tracking system that relies on depth cameras for 3D space input, combined with Simultaneous Localization and Mapping algorithm (SLAM, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) to track the target. Inside-out technology is not limited by space and is simple to set up, and is expected to become the technology trend of future VR/AR devices.

 5G is expected to open the VR/AR growth ceiling. 5G has three major characteristics: 

 1) Large broadband: 20G downlink rate; 

 2) Low latency: 1ms ultra-low latency; 

 3) Large connection: per kilometer, connect super 1 million devices. 5G boosts the cloud-based processor, enhances the level of computing power, simplifies equipment and reduces costs.
