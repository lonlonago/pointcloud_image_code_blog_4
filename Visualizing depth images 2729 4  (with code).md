Visualize the depth image as a point cloud in a 3D window (the depth image comes from the point cloud), and the other is to map the depth value to color to visualize the depth image as a color image. 

 New project ch4_2, new file range_image_visualization cpp, fill in the following 

 The result of compiling and running the executable file is: 

 Run./range_image_visualization (no .pcd file specified)

 Using an automatically generated rectangular space point cloud, there are two windows, a 3D visualization window for the point cloud and a visualization window for the depth image, where the color of the image is determined by the depth.

 Of course, if you specify the PCD file can also be, for example:./range_image_visualization room_scan1 pcd the result
